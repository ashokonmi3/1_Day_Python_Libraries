    "A Large Language Model (LLM) is an AI model that can understand and generate human language. It is trained on large amounts of text data and uses mathematical models called neural networks. LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini use Transformer architecture to understand context and generate responses."

    "\n",
    "1. **Training Phase**\n",
    "   - Read **huge amounts of text** (books, websites, etc.)\n",
    "   - Learn how words and sentences are structured\n",
    "   - Predict the **next word** in a sentence again and again\n",
    "   - The model adjusts itself to get better predictions\n",

    "2. **Inference Phase (Answering Questions)**\n",
    "   - You give it a prompt/question\n",
    "   - The model uses what it learned to guess the best next words\n",
    "   - It forms a meaningful response\n",
